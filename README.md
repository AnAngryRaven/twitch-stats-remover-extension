# Twitch Statistics Remover
Twitch Statistics Remover does just what it says -- removes a variety of statistics from Twitch!
## Installation

 * [Mozilla Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/twitch-statistics-remover) - *Not currently available for Firefox for Android!*
 * Google Chrome - *Coming soon!*

## Features

Statistics currently include:

 - Viewership numbers
 - Follower counts
 - Channel leaderboards
 - Channel goals

Each option can be enabled or disabled to your liking.

*Note: The extension does not currently function in the creator dashboard*

## Planned Features

In the future, I'd like to add the ability to:

 - Disable hypetrains
 - Remove stream uptime counters
 - Disable / modify chat notifications (resubs, raids, etc)
 - Add creator dashboard support

## Issues
Bugs and / or feature enhancements can be submitted via the [issues page](https://github.com/anangryraven/twitch-stats-remover/issues).
