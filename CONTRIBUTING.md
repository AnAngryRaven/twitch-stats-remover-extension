Thank you for considering contributing!! This file should (hopefully) help you with doing so, in addition to providing general guidelines 🙂‍↕️

# A Note on AI Contributions
Please note that contributions utilizing generative AI tools for *either* code *or* translation contributions will not be accepted. Any attempt at circumventing this policy (for instance, by submitting a pull request containing generative content without disclosure) *can* and potentially *will* result in any future pull requests from you being closed without comment, **regardless of whether or not those future contributions contain content from a generative AI tool!**

It is kindly asked that you respect this policy, and do not attempt to submit AI-assisted contributions. If you have questions regarding this policy, please feel free to ask a question in the GitHub discussions tab 🙂‍↕️

# Translations
Hopefully, implementing a translation into the extension *should* be relatively painless; if not, please feel free to open an issue on how it could be improved!! ^^

To do so:
 1. Locate the [language tag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IETF_language_tag#List_of_common_primary_language_subtags) of the language you wish to translate to
 2. Create a folder in the `_locales` directory with the name your language tag
 3. Copy the `messages.json` file from the `template` folder into the folder you just created
 4. Begin translating!

If any of the translation tags are unclear, feel free to open a discussion on [GitHub](https://github.com/AnAngryRaven/twitch-stats-remover-extension/discussions/categories/translations), or, if preferred, by email at: raven@guhcat.com

Finally, if memory serves, the translation is applied depending on the language set *specifically by your browser*.

# Code
I don't have any specific guidelines for contributing on the code side of things right now other than: Godspeed, soldier 🫡
